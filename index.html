            Hi, I'm Jordon Q! &#x1F44B;
          </h1>
          <p>
            Hello, my name is Jordon Quentin and I am a web developer based in New York City. I have over 5 years of experience working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive and engaging websites and web applications for clients in a variety of industries.

When I'm not coding, you can usually find me hiking in the mountains, playing guitar, or trying out new recipes in the kitchen.

If you're interested in working together or just want to chat about web development, feel free to get in touch!
